This is a weather application that allows you to search an areas weather forecast.

This app will give the current weather data as well as a forecast.

You will need to get this app to compile on android, IOS and web. There are Todos in the code that will help
guide you to get there.

The forecast component has not been built yet, so please add this functional requirement as well. The assets that are required have already been included.
Here below are the designs for what the forecast should look like:

This code needs to be unit and widget tested as well to ensure that if any changes are made that those tests would pick it up and report the errors.

This application uses Provider for state management and an http handler has been built to control all of the API calls.
